Happy reading!","content":"Social Media can be  soooo toxic.\n\nUgh here we go again.\n\nThat word has been used to death in online circles to the point where it has even lost its meaning.\nHowever, I’m here to remind you that there is some truth to that. Think of the countless ways we compare ourselves with our peers on Instagram setting up unrealistic expectations for ourselves, or worse still the daily bickering over whatever hot button political issue has caught our attention.\n\nThe truth is, as time goes on this gets really and I mean really draining, so this is where I think Linden Ustawi, as a platform stands out.\n\nLook, we’re not going to promise you the moon and more by claiming that using our service is going to shield you from all the negative stuff online cause one, that would be lying and two we respect your intelligence too much to do that.\n\nHowever, we want you to think of our daily health blogs as quick, timely breaks from the hustle and bustle of virtual life which at this point we can’t live completely without.\n\nThank you for coming on this journey with us, and I can guarantee that it will be worth your time.\n\n\n\n","publishedAt":"2020-09-07T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"publicURL":"/static/07fd30003394668a43e9ce6d7a5843f6/00944356cb257af63389aa7ec8905fc6.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/07fd30003394668a43e9ce6d7a5843f6/2244e/00944356cb257af63389aa7ec8905fc6.jpg"}}},"author":{"name":"Osemedua Iwelumo","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/4489746858ca16439587b8d750210628/58a4b/9eda74f432b08f32f58959bb8f882a03.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"welcome-to-linden-ustawi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["161018792","2031881183","557794130"]}
