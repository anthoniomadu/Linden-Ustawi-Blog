I get, I really do. Engaging in an activity that is basically frowned upon by the larger society can give you a sense of excitement and wonder but the truth is with smoking especially as its portrayed in popular media is literally smoke and mirrors (get it?)\nSmoking is one hundred percent bad news as it can:\n\n1. Increase the chances of contracting all sorts of heart diseases and cardiovascular problems like heart attacks and strokes.\n\n2. Reduce the effectiveness of your body's immune system in fighting off diseases and other threats.\n\n3. Lead to the death of your infant if you smoke will being pregnant which is totally depressing to think about.\n\n4. Seriously yellow your teeth, give you all sorts of gum problems and can even discolor your skin.\n\n5. Weaken the density of your bones which basically makes your skeleton weaker which in the event of an accident where you break your bone(s) it's going to take a much longer time to heal than if you weren't smoking.\n\n\n\nThere is literally no upside to smoking and if you need help kicking the habit I would advise that you see a doctor and engage in some Cognitive Behavioral Therapy while also engaging in some mindfulness exercises in order to grow more self-aware whenever the urge to smoke comes to you can nip it in the bud. When you leave smoking behind your quality of life will definitely go up as your life expectancy goes up along with ease of breathing and lower risks of contracting many cardiovascular diseases  :)","publishedAt":"2020-09-18T11:00:00.000Z","image":{"publicURL":"/static/ca14a0537b3f850b85772539d4002148/85048bc9b2228c790f0aee7346c3b84f.jpg","childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/ca14a0537b3f850b85772539d4002148/2244e/85048bc9b2228c790f0aee7346c3b84f.jpg"}}},"author":{"name":"Osemedua Iwelumo","picture":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"src":"/static/4489746858ca16439587b8d750210628/58a4b/9eda74f432b08f32f58959bb8f882a03.jpg"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-dangers-of-smoking"}},"staticQueryHashes":["161018792","2031881183","557794130"]}
